# World – Continents & Country Shapes

Interactive world map showing all continents and the geographic shape of each country.

## Features

- **Continents list** – All 7 continents with their countries (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Oceania, Antarctica)
- **Country shapes** – Real geographic boundaries for each country, drawn from Natural Earth data
- **Interactive** – Click a continent to expand and highlight its countries on the map; hover countries to see names and continents

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or drag into a tab). The map loads country boundaries from a CDN and works without a server.

Or use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then open http://localhost:3000
